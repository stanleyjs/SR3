%% The scales are stored ratio-wise in SR3{}

% SR3{i} has fields
% SR3{i}.ratio - the ratio that was used to generate this sequence
% SR3{i}.m
% SR3{i}.gammas - the ACTUAL gammas that resulted from taking the ratio *
% the following.

%% AN individual SR3{i}.SR3{j} run is stored in the resulting SR3.output
% here i corresponds to the ratio and j corresponds to the magnitude
% Params are kept in SR3

% SR3.output.U is the resulting tensor from the final optimization step
% You will need to call double() on it to make it a matrix.

% SR3.output.V is a cell of the shrunken difference tensors at the last output.
% Again you must call double() to make it a matrix for imagesc and other
% applicaitons.


% SR3.output.F will store your objective function results for each
% iteration (i.e. call to PCG)
% Column 1 is the total loss
% column 2 is the loss due to l2 error between X and U
% column 3 is the loss due to the sum of snowflake of V
% column 4 is the loss due to l2 error between U's differences and the
% elements of V
% teh remaining columns are the total mode-wise losses.
